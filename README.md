I created this app on base this <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/Gw0ZNBbYN8asqFlZWy3jG1">design</a>. 

It's a little game when you want to waste your time on the unuseful things. This game has two types of questions: 
- you need to choose right country, base on the capital; 
- you need to choose right country, base on a flag;

Tools that i used:
- React;
- TypeScript;
- Scss/Sass;
- Redux Toolkit;
- <a href="https://restcountries.com/">API</a>
